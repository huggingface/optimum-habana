# Text Generation Inference on Habana Gaudi

To use [ðŸ¤— text-generation-inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) on Habana Gaudi/Gaudi2, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image located in this folder with:
   ```bash
   docker build -t tgi_gaudi .
   ```
2. Launch a local server instance with:
   ```bash
   model=bigscience/bloom-560m
   volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

   docker run -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --runtime=habana -e HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none --cap-add=sys_nice --ipc=host tgi_gaudi --model-id $model
   ```
3. You can then send a request:
   ```bash
   curl 127.0.0.1:8080/generate \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":17, "do_sample": true}}' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```
   > The first call will be slower as the model is compiled.

> For gated models such as [StarCoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder), you will have to pass `-e HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=<token>` to the `docker run` command above with a valid Hugging Face Hub read token.

For more information and documentation about Text Generation Inference, checkout [the README](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference#text-generation-inference) of the original repo.

Not all features of TGI are currently supported as this is still a work in progress.
It has been tested for batches of 1 sample so far.
New features will be added soon, including:
- support for DeepSpeed-inference to use sharded models
- batching strategy to have less model compilations
- Added an env var MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS for models that require it to be set during benchmark test.
  It defaults to 0. To change it please add "ENV MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS=512" (512 is an example) to Dockerfile and rebuild the docker.
  This workaround is needed as max_total_tokens is currently not being passed from Rust to Python when running launcher app.
