    Wraps a PyTorch `DataLoader` to generate batches for one of the processes only.

    Depending on the value of the `drop_last` attribute of the `dataloader` passed, it will either stop the iteration
    at the first batch that would be too small / not present on all processes or loop with indices from the beginning.

    Args:
        dataloader (`torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader`):
            The data loader to split across several devices.
        device (`torch.device`):
            The target device for the returned `DataLoader`.
        num_processes (`int`, *optional*):
            The number of processes running concurrently. Will default to the value given by
            [`GaudiAcceleratorState`].
        process_index (`int`, *optional*):
            The index of the current process. Will default to the value given by [`GaudiAcceleratorState`].
        split_batches (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the resulting `DataLoader` should split the batches of the original data loader across devices or
            yield full batches (in which case it will yield batches starting at the `process_index`-th and advancing of
            `num_processes` batches at each iteration).

            Another way to see this is that the observed batch size will be the same as the initial `dataloader` if
            this option is set to `True`, the batch size of the initial `dataloader` multiplied by `num_processes`
            otherwise.

            Setting this option to `True` requires that the batch size of the `dataloader` is a round multiple of
            `batch_size`.
        put_on_device (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to put the batches on `device` (only works if the batches are nested list, tuples or
            dictionaries of tensors).
        rng_types (list of `str` or [`~utils.RNGType`]):
            The list of random number generators to synchronize at the beginning of each iteration. Should be one or
            several of:

            - `"torch"`: the base torch random number generator
            - `"cuda"`: the CUDA random number generator (GPU only)
            - `"xla"`: the XLA random number generator (TPU only)
            - `"generator"`: the `torch.Generator` of the sampler (or batch sampler if there is no sampler in your
              dataloader) or of the iterable dataset (if it exists) if the underlying dataset is of that type.

        dispatch_batches (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, the datalaoder prepared is only iterated through on the main process and then the batches
            are split and broadcast to each process. Will default to `True` when the underlying dataset is an
            `IterableDataset`, `False` otherwise.
        even_batches (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If set to `True`, in cases where the total batch size across all processes does not exactly divide the
            dataset, samples at the start of the dataset will be duplicated so the batch can be divided equally among
            all workers.
        slice_fn_for_dispatch (`Callable`, *optional*`):
            If passed, this function will be used to slice tensors across `num_processes`. Will default to
            [`~utils.slice_tensors`]. This argument is used only when `dispatch_batches` is set to `True` and will be
            ignored otherwise.
        use_seedable_sampler (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use the [`~data_loader.SeedableRandomSampler`] instead of a `RandomSampler` for better
            reproducability. Comes at a cost of potentially different performances due to different shuffling
            algorithms but ensures results will be the *exact* same.

    Returns:
        `torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader`: A new data loader that will yield the portion of the batches

    <Tip warning={true}>

    `BatchSampler`s with varying batch sizes are not enabled by default. To enable this behaviour, set `even_batches`
    equal to `False`
