# Multi-node Training

Using several Gaudi servers to perform multi-node training can be done easily. This guide shows how to:
- set up several Gaudi instances
- set up your computing environment
- launch a multi-node run


## Setting up several Gaudi instances

Two types of configurations are possible:
- scale-out using Gaudi NICs or Host NICs (on-premises)
- scale-out using AWS DL1


### On premises

To set up your servers on premises, check out the [installation](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Bare_Metal_Fresh_OS.html) and [distributed training](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/PyTorch_Scaling_Guide/index.html) pages of Habana Gaudi's documentation.


### AWS DL1 instances

Follow the following steps to correctly set up your DL1 instances.


#### 1. Set up an EFA-enabled security group

To allow all instances to communicate with each other, you need to set up a *security group* as described by AWS in step 1 of [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa-start.html#efa-start-security).
Once this is done, it should look as follows:
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Rules of the security group" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimum/documentation-images/resolve/main/habana/multi_node_security_group.png" width="800">
    <em style="color: grey">Security group for multi-node training on AWS DL1 instances</em>
</p>


#### 2. Launching instances

When you launch instances from the AWS EC2 console, you can choose the number of nodes to set up.

We recommend using the [Habana Deep Learning Base AMI](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Habana_Deep_Learning_AMI.html) for your AWS DL1 instances.
It is an EFA-enabled AMI so you do not need to install the EFA software (which may be necessary if you use a different AMI).

Then, in the *Network settings*, select the *security group* you created in the previous step. You also have to select a specific *subnet* to unlock the *Advanced network configuration* in which you can enable the *Elastic Fabric Adapter*.

The last parameter to set is the *Placement group* in the *Advanced details*. You can create one if you do not have any. The *placement strategy* should be set to *cluster*.

Here is how it should look:
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Rules of the security group" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimum/documentation-images/resolve/main/habana/multi_node_launch_instances.png" width="800">
    <em style="color: grey">Parameters for launching EFA-enabled AWS instances. The important parameters to set are circled in red. For the sake of clarity, not all parameters are represented.</em>
</p>

More information [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa-start.html#efa-start-instances).


## Launching a Multi-node Run

Once your Gaudi instances are ready, you need to:

1. Enable password-less SSH on your instances so that they can communicate with each other. [This explains how to do it](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/AWS_User_Guides/AWS_Distributed_Training_Multiple_DL1/AWS_Distributed_Training_Multiple_DL1.html#running-distributed-training-over-multiple-dl1-instances).
2. On AWS, to train through EFA, `hccl_ofi_wrapper` should be installed. [Here is how to do it](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/AWS_User_Guides/AWS_Distributed_Training_Multiple_DL1/AWS_Distributed_Training_Multiple_DL1.html#build-and-store-custom-docker-image-for-training).
3. On AWS, you need to set the following environment variables (the easiest way is to write a `.deepspeed_env` file as described [here](here)):
  - `HCCL_OVER_OFI=1` and `HCCL_OVER_TCP=0`
  - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_hccl_ofi_wrapper:/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib:/opt/amazon/efa/lib` where `path_to_hccl_ofi_wrapper` is the path to the `hccl_ofi_wrapper` folder which you installed in the previous step.
  - (optional) `HCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=my_network_interface`. If not set, the first network interface with a name that does not start with `lo` or `docker` will be used. More information [here](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/API_Reference_Guides/HCCL_APIs/Using_HCCL.html?highlight=HCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME#hccl-socket-ifname).

To make this easier, we provide a Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/blob/multi_node/examples/multi-node-training/Dockerfile). You will just have to copy the public key of the leader node in the `authorized_keys` file of all other nodes.

Then, you need to write a hostfile with the addresses and the numbers of devices of your nodes as follows:
```
ip_1 slots=8
ip_2 slots=8
...
ip_n slots=8
```

Finally, there are two possible ways to run your training script on several nodes:

1. With the [`gaudi_spawn.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/blob/main/examples/gaudi_spawn.py) script, you can run the following command:
```bash
python gaudi_spawn.py \
    --hostfile path_to_my_hostfile --use_deepspeed \
    path_to_my_script.py --args1 --args2 ... --argsN \
    --deepspeed path_to_my_deepspeed_config
```
where `--argX` is an argument of the script to run.
2. With the[`~distributed.DistributedRunner`], you can add this code snippet to a script:
```python
from optimum.habana.distributed import DistributedRunner

distributed_runner = DistributedRunner(
    command_list=["path_to_my_script.py --args1 --args2 ... --argsN"],
    hostfile=path_to_my_hostfile,
    use_deepspeed=True,
)
```


## Environment Variables

If you need to set environment variables for all nodes, you can specify them in a `.deepspeed_env` file which is located in the same folder as the script you are calling. It is formatted as follows:
```
env_variable_1_name=value
env_variable_2_name=value
...
```

You can find an example for AWS instances [here](path_to_deepspeed_env).


## Recommendations

- It is strongly recommended to use gradient checkpointing for multi-node runs to get the highest speedups. You can enable it with `--gradient_checkpointing` in [these examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) or with `gradient_checkpointing=True` in your `GaudiTrainingArguments`.
- Larger batch sizes should lead to higher speedups.
- Multi-node inference is not recommended and can provide inconsistent results.
- On AWS DL1 instances, run your Docker containers with the `--privileged` flag so that EFA devices are visible.
