# Accelerating Inference

Gaudi provides a way to run fast inference with HPU Graphs.
It consists in capturing a series of operations (i.e. graphs) in a HPU stream and then replaying them in an optimized way (more information [here](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Inference_on_Gaudi/Inference_using_HPU_Graphs/Inference_using_HPU_Graphs.html)).
Thus, you can apply this to the `forward` method of your model to run it efficiently at inference.

HPU Graphs are integrated into the [`GaudiTrainer`](../package_reference/trainer) and the [`GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline`](../package_reference/stable_diffusion_pipeline) so that one can use them very easily:
- `GaudiTrainer` needs the training argument `use_hpu_graphs` to be set to `True` as follows:
```python
from optimum.habana import GaudiTrainer, GaudiTrainingArguments

# define the training arguments
training_args = GaudiTrainingArguments(
    use_habana=True,
    use_lazy_mode=True,
    use_hpu_graphs=True,
    gaudi_config_name=gaudi_config_name,
    ...
)

# Initialize our Trainer
trainer = GaudiTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset
    ... # other arguments
)
```
- `GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline` needs its argument `use_hpu_graphs` to be set to `True` such as:
```python
from optimum.habana.diffusers import GaudiDDIMScheduler, GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline

model_name = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"

scheduler = GaudiDDIMScheduler.from_pretrained(model_name, subfolder="scheduler")

pipeline = GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    use_habana=True,
    use_hpu_graphs=True,
    gaudi_config="Habana/stable-diffusion",
)

outputs = generator(
    ["An image of a squirrel in Picasso style"],
    num_images_per_prompt=16,
    batch_size=4,
)
```

<Tip warning={true}>

With HPU Graphs and in lazy mode, the *first couple of training iterations* may be slower due to graph compilations.
