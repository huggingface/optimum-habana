# Pretraining a model with Optimum Habana

Pretraining a model can be done as easily as fine-tuning it.

For fine-tuning, you instantiate the model as follows:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForXXX

model = AutoModelForXXX.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
with XXX the task to perform, such as `ImageClassification` for example.

In the case of pretraining, the model is instantiated from a configuration and not from a pretrained checkpoint:
```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForXXX

config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(config_name)
model = AutoModelForXXX.from_config(config)
```

<Tip warning={true}>

For some models, you may need to specify `ddp_find_unused_parameters=True` in your training arguments to perform pretraining.

</Tip>

You can see an example of pretraining in [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/pretraining-bert).
