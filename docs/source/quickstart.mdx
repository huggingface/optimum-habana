# Quickstart

ðŸ¤— Optimum Habana was designed with one goal in mind: **making training and evaluation straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of Gaudi processors**.
There are two main classes one needs to know:
- [`GaudiTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/trainer): the trainer class that takes care of compiling (lazy or eager mode) and distributing the model to run on HPUs, and of performing training and evaluation.
- [`GaudiConfig`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/gaudi_config): the class that enables to configure Habana Mixed Precision and to decide whether optimized operators and optimizers should be used or not.

The [`GaudiTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/trainer) is very similar to the [ðŸ¤— Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer), and adapting a script using the Trainer to make it work with Gaudi will mostly consist in simply swapping the `Trainer` class for the `GaudiTrainer` one.
That is how most of the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) were adapted from their [original counterparts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch).

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+from optimum.habana import GaudiTrainer, GaudiTrainingArguments

# define the training arguments
-training_args = TrainingArguments(
+training_args = GaudiTrainingArguments(
+  use_habana=True,
+  use_lazy_mode=True,
+  use_hpu_graphs=True,
+  gaudi_config_name=gaudi_config_name,
  ...
)

# Initialize our Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = GaudiTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset
    ... # other arguments
)
```

where `gaudi_config_name` is the name of a model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/Habana) (Gaudi configurations are stored in model repositories). You can also give the path to a custom Gaudi configuration written in a JSON file such as this one:
```json
{
  "use_habana_mixed_precision": true,
  "hmp_is_verbose": false,
  "use_fused_adam": true,
  "use_fused_clip_norm": true,
  "hmp_bf16_ops": [
    "add",
    "addmm",
    "bmm",
    "div",
    "dropout",
    "gelu",
    "iadd",
    "linear",
    "layer_norm",
    "matmul",
    "mm",
    "rsub",
    "softmax",
    "truediv"
  ],
  "hmp_fp32_ops": [
    "embedding",
    "nll_loss",
    "log_softmax"
  ]
}
```

If you prefer to instantiate a Gaudi configuration to work on it before giving it to the trainer, you can do it as follows:
```python
gaudi_config = GaudiConfig.from_pretrained(
    gaudi_config_name,
    cache_dir=model_args.cache_dir,
    revision=model_args.model_revision,
    use_auth_token=True if model_args.use_auth_token else None,
)
```


## Stable Diffusion

ðŸ¤— Optimum Habana also features HPU-optimized support for the ðŸ¤— Diffusers library.
Thus, you can easily deploy Stable Diffusion on Gaudi for performing text-to-image generation.

Here is how to use it and the differences with the ðŸ¤— Diffusers library:
```diff
- from diffusers import DDIMScheduler, StableDiffusionPipeline
+ from optimum.habana.diffusers import GaudiDDIMScheduler, GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline


model_name = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"

- scheduler = DDIMScheduler.from_pretrained(model_name, subfolder="scheduler")
+ scheduler = GaudiDDIMScheduler.from_pretrained(model_name, subfolder="scheduler")

- pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
+ pipeline = GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    scheduler=scheduler,
+   use_habana=True,
+   use_hpu_graphs=True,
+   gaudi_config="Habana/stable-diffusion",
)

outputs = generator(
    ["An image of a squirrel in Picasso style"],
    num_images_per_prompt=16,
+   batch_size=4,
)
```
