# Optimum Habana

🤗 Optimum Habana is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers library and [Habana's Gaudi processor (HPU)](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/index.html). It provides a set of tools enabling easy model loading and fine-tuning on single- and multi-HPU settings for different downstream tasks.
The current release focuses on question answering and text classification and enables users to try other models for other tasks with only a few changes.

## What is a Habana Processing Unit (HPU)?

Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana):

> Habana Gaudi training solutions, which power Amazon's EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicro's X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habana’s SynapseAI® is optimized—at inception—to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications.


## Install
To install the latest release of this package:

`pip install optimum[habana]`

Optimum Habana is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install it from source:

`pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana.git`

Last but not least, don't forget to install requirements for every example:

`cd <example-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt`

> Alternatively, you can install the package without pip as follows:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana.git
> cd optimum-habana
> python setup.py install
> ```

Other models and tasks supported by the 🤗 Transformers library may also work. You can refer to this [section](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana#how-to-use-it) for using them with 🤗 Optimum Habana. Besides, [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) explains how to modify any [example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch) from the 🤗 Transformers library to make it work with 🤗 Optimum Habana.

If you find any issue while using those, please open an issue or a pull request.


## Gaudi Setup

Please refer to Habana Gaudi's official [installation guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/index.html).

> Tests should be run in a Docker container based on Habana Docker images.
