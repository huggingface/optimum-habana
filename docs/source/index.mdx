# 🤗 Optimum Habana

🤗 Optimum Habana is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers and 🤗 Diffusers libraries and [Habana's Gaudi processor (HPU)](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/index.html).
It provides a set of tools that enable easy model loading, training and inference on single- and multi-HPU settings for various downstream tasks as shown in the table below.

HPUs offer fast model training and inference as well as a great price-performance ratio.
Check out [this blog post about BERT pre-training](https://huggingface.co/blog/pretraining-bert) and [this article benchmarking Habana Gaudi2 versus Nvidia A100 GPUs](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark) for concrete examples.
If you are not familiar with HPUs, we recommend you take a look at [our conceptual guide](./concept_guides/hpu).

Other models and tasks supported by the 🤗 Transformers library may also work.
You can refer to [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) for examples of how to use them with 🤗 Optimum Habana.
Besides, the [Quickstart](./quickstart) explains how to modify any [example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch) from the 🤗 Transformers library to make it work with 🤗 Optimum Habana.
