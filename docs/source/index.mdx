# 🤗 Optimum Habana

🤗 Optimum Habana is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers library and [Habana's Gaudi processor (HPU)](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/index.html). It provides a set of tools enabling easy model loading and training on single- and multi-HPU settings for different downstream tasks.
The list of officially validated models and tasks is available [here](validated-models). Users can try other models and tasks with only few changes.

## What is a Habana Processing Unit (HPU)?

Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana):

> Habana Gaudi training solutions, which power Amazon's EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicro's X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habana’s SynapseAI® is optimized—at inception—to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications.


## Install
To install the latest release of this package:

```bash
pip install optimum[habana]
```

<Tip>

To use DeepSpeed on HPUs, you also need to run the following command:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/HabanaAI/DeepSpeed.git@1.6.0
```

</Tip>

Optimum Habana is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install it from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana.git
```

<Tip>

Alternatively, you can install the package without pip as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana.git
cd optimum-habana
python setup.py install
```

</Tip>

Last but not least, don't forget to install requirements for every example:

```bash
cd <example-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Other models and tasks supported by the 🤗 Transformers library may also work. You can refer to this [section](quickstart) for using them with 🤗 Optimum Habana. Besides, [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) explains how to modify any [example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch) from the 🤗 Transformers library to make it work with 🤗 Optimum Habana.

If you find any issue while using those, please open an issue or a pull request in the [Github repository of the project](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana).


## Gaudi Setup

Please refer to Habana Gaudi's official [installation guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/index.html).

<Tip>

Tests should be run in a Docker container based on Habana Docker images.
