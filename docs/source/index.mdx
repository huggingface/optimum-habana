# 🤗 Optimum Habana

🤗 Optimum Habana is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers library and [Habana's Gaudi processor (HPU)](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/index.html). It provides a set of tools that enable simple model loading and training on single- and multi-HPU settings for various downstream tasks.


The table below shows which model architectures, tasks and device distributions are currently supported for 🤗 Optimum Habana:

|            | Text Classification | Question Answering | Language Modeling  | Summarization | Translation | Image Classification | Single Card | Multi Card | DeepSpeed |

Other models and tasks supported by the 🤗 Transformers library may also work. You can refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) for examples on using them with 🤗 Optimum Habana. Besides, [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) explains how to modify any [example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch) from the 🤗 Transformers library to make it work with 🤗 Optimum Habana.
