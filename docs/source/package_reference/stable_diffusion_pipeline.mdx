# GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline` class enables to perform text-to-image generation on HPUs.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.

To get the most out of it, it should be associated with a scheduler that is optimized for HPUs like `GaudiDDIMScheduler`.

# GaudiStableDiffusionXLPipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionXLPipeline` class enables to perform text-to-image generation on HPUs using SDXL models.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.

To get the most out of it, it should be associated with a scheduler that is optimized for HPUs like `GaudiDDIMScheduler`.
Recommended schedulers are `GaudiEulerDiscreteScheduler` for SDXL base and `GaudiEulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler` for SDXL turbo.

# GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline` is used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4 on HPUs.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.

# GaudiDDPMPipeline

The `GaudiDDPMPipeline` is to enable unconditional image generations on HPUs. It has similar APIs as the regular `DiffusionPipeline`.
It shares a common parent class, `GaudiDiffusionPipeline`, with other existing Gaudi pipelines. It now supports both DDPM and DDIM scheduler. 
It is recommended to use the optimized scheduler, `GaudiDDIMScheduler`, to obtain the best performance and image outputs.
