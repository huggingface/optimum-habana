# GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline` class enables to perform text-to-image generation on HPUs.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.

To get the most out of it, it should be associated with a scheduler that is optimized for HPUs like `GaudiDDIMScheduler`.
