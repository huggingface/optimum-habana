# GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionPipeline` class enables to perform text-to-image generation on HPUs.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.

To get the most out of it, it should be associated with a scheduler that is optimized for HPUs like `GaudiDDIMScheduler`.

# GaudiStableDiffusionXLPipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionXLPipeline` class enables to perform text-to-image generation on HPUs using SDXL models.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.

To get the most out of it, it should be associated with a scheduler that is optimized for HPUs like `GaudiDDIMScheduler`.
Recommended schedulers are `GaudiEulerDiscreteScheduler` for SDXL base and `GaudiEulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler` for SDXL turbo.

# GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline

The `GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline` is used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4 on HPUs.
It inherits from the `GaudiDiffusionPipeline` class that is the parent to any kind of diffuser pipeline.
