# Single-HPU Training

Training on a single device is as simple as in Transformers:
- You need to replace the Transformers' [`Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class by the [`GaudiTrainer`] class,
- You need to replace the Transformers' [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) class by the [`GaudiTrainingArguments`] class and add the following arguments:
    - `use_habana` to execute your script on a HPU,
    - `use_lazy_mode` to use lazy mode or not (i.e. eager mode),
    - `gaudi_config_name` to give the name of (Hub) or the path to (local) your Gaudi configuration file.

You can find several examples in the official repository for the following tasks:
- [language modeling](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/language-modeling),
- [question answering](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/question-answering),
- [summarization](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/summarization),
- [text classification](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/text-classification),
- [translation](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/translation),
- [image classification](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/image-classification).
