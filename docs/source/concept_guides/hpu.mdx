# What is a Habana Processing Unit (HPU)?

Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana):

> Habana Gaudi training solutions, which power Amazon's EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicro's X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habana’s SynapseAI® is optimized—at inception—to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications.
