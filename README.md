# Optimum Habana

ðŸ¤— Optimum Habana is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and [Habana's Gaudi processor (HPU)](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/index.html).
It provides a set of tools enabling easy model loading and fine-tuning on single- and multi-HPU settings for different downstream tasks.
The current release focuses on question answering and text classification and enables users to try other models for other tasks with only a few changes.


## What is a Habana Processing Unit (HPU)?

Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana):

> Habana Gaudi training solutions, which power Amazonâ€™s EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicroâ€™s X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habanaâ€™s SynapseAIÂ® is optimizedâ€”at inceptionâ€”to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications.


## Install
To install the latest release of this package:

`pip install optimum[habana]`

Optimum Habana is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install it from source:

`pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana.git`

Last but not least, don't forget to install requirements for every example:

`cd <example-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt`

> Alternatively, you can install the package without pip as follows:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana.git
> cd optimum-habana
> python setup.py install
> ```


## How to use it?
ðŸ¤— Optimum Habana was designed with one goal in mind: **make training and evaluation straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of Gaudi processors**.
There are two main classes one needs to know:
- GaudiTrainer: the trainer class that takes care of compiling (lazy or eager mode) and distributing the model to run on HPUs, and of performing traning and evaluation.
- GaudiConfig: the class that enables to configure Habana Mixed Precision and to decide whether optimized operators and optimizers should be used or not.

The `GaudiTrainer` is very similar to the [ðŸ¤— Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer), and adapting a script using the Trainer to make it work with Gaudi will mostly consist in simply swapping the `Trainer` class for the `GaudiTrainer` one.
That's how most of the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples) were adapted from their [original counterparts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch).

Original script:
```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
  # training arguments...
)

# A lot of code here

# Initialize our Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,  # Original training arguments.
    train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset if training_args.do_eval else None,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)
```


Transformed version that can run on Gaudi:
```python
from optimum.habana import GaudiConfig, GaudiTrainer, GaudiTrainingArguments

training_args = GaudiTrainingArguments(
  # same training arguments...
  use_habana=True,
  use_lazy_mode=True,  # whether to use lazy or eager mode
  gaudi_config_name=path_to_gaudi_config,
)

# A lot of the same code as the original script here

# Initialize our Trainer
trainer = GaudiTrainer(
    model=model,
    # You can manually specify the Gaudi configuration to use with
    # gaudi_config=my_gaudi_config
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset if training_args.do_eval else None,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)
```

where `gaudi_config_name` is the name of a model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/Habana) (Gaudi configurations are stored in model repositories). You can also give the path to a custom Gaudi configuration written in a JSON file such as this one:
```json
{
  "use_habana_mixed_precision": true,
  "hmp_opt_level": "O1",
  "hmp_is_verbose": false,
  "use_fused_adam": true,
  "use_fused_clip_norm": true,
  "hmp_bf16_ops": [
    "add",
    "addmm",
    "bmm",
    "div",
    "dropout",
    "gelu",
    "iadd",
    "linear",
    "layer_norm",
    "matmul",
    "mm",
    "rsub",
    "softmax",
    "truediv"
  ],
  "hmp_fp32_ops": [
    "embedding",
    "nll_loss",
    "log_softmax"
  ]
}
```

If you prefer to instantiate a Gaudi configuration to work on it before giving it to the trainer, you can do it as follows:
```python
gaudi_config = GaudiConfig.from_pretrained(
    gaudi_config_name,
    cache_dir=model_args.cache_dir,
    revision=model_args.model_revision,
    use_auth_token=True if model_args.use_auth_token else None,
)
```
